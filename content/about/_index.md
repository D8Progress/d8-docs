# About Deliber8 Progress

A gamified goal tracker designed for ADHD and autistic brains.

## Why We Built This

Most productivity apps are designed for neurotypical brains. They assume:

- ✗ Habits become automatic after 21/30/66 days
- ✗ Missing one day is a learning experience, not a shame spiral
- ✗ Motivation comes from within
- ✗ Calendars and due dates are helpful, not anxiety-inducing

**We know better.**

Deliber8 Progress is built by and for neurodivergent people who need:

- ✓ Ongoing external rewards (dopamine doesn't generate itself)
- ✓ Forgiveness mechanics (streak shields save streaks, not shame you)
- ✓ Flexible structures (not everything fits in a daily checklist)
- ✓ Week-based planning (because days are too granular and stressful)

## The Name

**D8** = "Deliberate" (Deliber-8, get it?)

We're not about hustle culture or productivity hacks. We're about making _deliberate_ progress on things that matter to you — at your own pace, with your own brain.

The "8" also looks like an infinity symbol (∞) turned sideways. Progress is ongoing. There's no "done."
