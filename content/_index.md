**D8 Progress** (pronounced "Deliberate Progress") is a productivity app built specifically for ADHD, autistic, and other neurodivergent minds.

Unlike traditional productivity apps that assume habits become automatic, D8 Progress provides ongoing dopamine rewards, flexible structures, and forgiveness-first mechanics that work WITH your brain, not against it.
