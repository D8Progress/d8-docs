## Traditional productivity apps fail neurodivergent brains.

They assume habits become automatic. They punish missed days. They treat motivation as a character flaw.

**Deliber8 Progress is different.**

## Features

### 🎮 Gamification That Works

XP, levels, streaks, achievements — ongoing dopamine rewards that never stop mattering.

### 🛡️ Forgiveness First

Streak shields prevent one bad day from ruining weeks of progress. Life happens.

### 📅 Week-Based Planning

Days are too granular. Weeks give you flexibility without losing structure.

### 🐉 Party System

Turn goals into characters you level up. Emotional investment beats willpower.

### 🧩 Flexible Objectives

Simple tasks, milestone projects, habits, checklists — the right structure for each goal.

### 💻 Open Source

Self-host it, contribute to it, make it yours.
