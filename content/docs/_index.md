Welcome to **Deliber8 Progress** — a gamified goal and task tracker designed specifically for neurodivergent brains (ADHD, autism, and friends).

## Why Deliber8 Progress?

Traditional productivity apps assume that once you build a habit, it becomes automatic. **That's not how our brains work.**

Deliber8 Progress provides:

- **Ongoing dopamine rewards** — XP, levels, achievements, and streaks that never stop mattering
- **Forgiveness-first mechanics** — Streak shields prevent shame spirals from one missed day
- **Flexible goal structures** — From simple task lists to complex milestone-based projects
- **Optional gamification depth** — Go full RPG with the Party System, or keep it minimal

## Getting Started

- **[Quick Start](getting-started/quick-start/)** — Get up and running in 5 minutes
- **[Core Concepts](getting-started/concepts/)** — Understand goals, objectives, and tasks
- **[Weekly View](features/weekly-view/)** — Your command center for the week
