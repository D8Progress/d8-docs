> **Note:** Activity features are available starting in version 0.8.

Life isn't just about tasks and habits. Deliber8 Progress helps you track the activities that bring joy and the dreams you want to achieve someday.

## Two Types of Activities

### Recurring Activities

Things you want to do regularly, but not as strict habits:

- Weekly date night
- Monthly game night with friends
- Quarterly deep cleaning
- Yearly camping trip

Unlike habits, recurring activities:

- Don't break streaks if missed
- Track "last done" without pressure
- Show gentle reminders when overdue
- Are more flexible in timing

### Bucket List Items

Dreams and experiences you want to have someday:

- Visit Iceland
- Learn to play guitar
- Run a marathon
- Write a book

Bucket list items:

- Have priority levels (dream, someday, planning, scheduled)
- Can track estimated costs and duration
- Move through stages as you plan them
- Celebrate when you complete them

## Tips for ADHD Brains

### Don't Overcommit

Start with just 2-3 recurring activities. You can always add more.

### Use "Whenever" Flexibility

For activities you want to remember but not stress about, set flexibility to "Whenever." No guilt, just tracking.

### Dream Big in Bucket List

Your bucket list is for dreaming! Don't filter yourself. Add everything you've ever wanted to do. You can always move priorities later.

### Review Monthly

Once a month, look at your activities:

- Which recurring activities are you actually doing?
- Which keep getting skipped? (Maybe remove or adjust frequency)
- Any bucket list items ready to move to "Planning"?

## Archiving Activities

When an activity is no longer relevant:

1. Open the activity
2. Click **Archive**

Archived activities:

- Don't appear in your main list
- Preserve all history
- Can be restored if you want to resume
