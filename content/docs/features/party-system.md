  Turn your goals into characters and level them up.

The **Party System** is Deliber8 Progress's most playful feature. Each goal becomes a character that you level up by working on it.

## The Concept

In RPGs, you have a party of characters, each with their own class, abilities, and progression. Deliber8 Progress applies this to your goals:

- **Goal** → **Character**
- **Completing tasks** → **XP for that character**
- **Character levels up** → **Equip gear from the shop**

## Creating Characters

When you create a goal, you can optionally enable Party Mode for it:

1. Create or edit a goal
2. Toggle "Enable Party Character"
3. Choose:
   - **Name** (can differ from goal name)
   - **Class** (Wizard, Warrior, Druid, etc.)

Your character starts at level 1 and gains XP whenever you complete tasks under that goal.

## Character Classes

Classes are cosmetic but thematic. Some shop items are class-exclusive:

| Class        | Theme                  | Example Goals               |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| ⚔️ Warrior   | Strength, discipline   | Fitness, sports, exercise   |
| 🧙 Wizard    | Knowledge, wisdom      | Learning, research, study   |
| 🌿 Druid     | Nature, growth         | Health, wellness, gardening |
| 🎭 Bard      | Creativity, expression | Art, music, writing         |
| ⚙️ Artificer | Innovation, building   | Projects, coding, crafting  |
| 👑 Noble     | Leadership, duty       | Work, responsibilities      |

## Character Mood

Characters have a **mood** based on recent activity:

- 😄 **Happy** — You've been active on this goal recently
- 😊 **Content** — Good progress in the past week
- 😐 **Neutral** — Some activity, could be more
- 😢 **Sad** — Goal has been neglected
- 😔 **Neglected** — No activity for a long time

Check the Party view to see how your characters are feeling!

## Your Party

View your full party from the **Party** screen (🎭 in the navbar):

- Characters show their current mood
- Click a character to see their stats and goal progress

## Gold

Working on goals earns **Gold** alongside XP:

| Action             | Gold Earned |
| ------------------ | ----------: |
| Complete a task    |          +5 |
| Complete a habit   |          +8 |
| Complete objective |         +25 |
| Achieve a goal     |        +100 |
| 7-day streak bonus |         +50 |

Your gold balance appears in the navbar. Spend it in the Shop!

## The Shop

## Daily Login Rewards

Log in daily to claim bonus gold and XP! Rewards increase with consecutive logins:

| Day | Gold | XP  | Notes               |
| --- | ---- | --- | ------------------- |
| 1   | 10   | 15  | Base reward         |

| 6   | 35   | 65  |                     |
| 7   | 95   | 185 | Week milestone!     |

After day 7, the streak continues but bonuses cap. Miss a day and the streak resets.

## Why Party Mode?

1. **Emotional investment** — It's easier to "abandon" a goal than a character you've leveled up
2. **Visual progress** — Watching characters grow feels more tangible than numbers
3. **Fun** — Productivity doesn't have to be boring

Not for everyone, and that's okay. The [gamification modes]({{< ref "gamification#gamification-modes" >}}) let you opt out entirely.
