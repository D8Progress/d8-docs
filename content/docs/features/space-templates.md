## Best Practices

### Start with Built-in Templates

The Family and Friend Group templates cover most common needs. Start there and customize.

### Don't Over-Engineer

New spaces don't need 20 channels. Start with:

- #general
- #announcements
- 2-3 topic channels

Add more as needed.

### Name Templates Clearly

Good names:

- "Work - Client Project"
- "Personal - Side Projects"
- "Family - Nuclear"

Vague names:

- "Template 1"
- "New template"
- "Copy of Space"

### Review Before Saving

Before saving a space as a template:

1. Remove one-off channels
2. Clear descriptions of temporary content
3. Ensure categories make sense generically

## Tips for ADHD Brains

### Templates Reduce Decision Fatigue

Instead of deciding channel structure every time, just pick a template. Done.

### Create a "Minimal" Template

For when you want to start a space but can't decide on structure:

- #general
- #random

That's it. Add more later.

### Save As You Go

When you create a space structure you love, save it immediately. Future you will thank past you.

### Use Templates for Consistency

If you have multiple similar spaces (work projects, client teams), using the same template keeps them consistent. Less mental overhead switching between them.
