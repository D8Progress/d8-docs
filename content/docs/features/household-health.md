> **Note:** Household and Health features require a Family or higher plan, available starting in version 0.8.

Managing health information for yourself and your family can be overwhelming. Deliber8 Progress helps you keep track of everyone's health details in one secure place.

## Household Members

Add the people (and pets!) in your household to track health information for everyone.

### Adding a Household Member

2. Click **Add Member**
3. Fill in their details:
   - **Name** — Their full name
   - **Nickname** — Optional short name for display
   - **Relationship** — How they relate to you (self, spouse, child, parent, pet, etc.)
   - **Date of Birth** — For age-appropriate health tracking
4. Click **Save**

### Relationship Types

| Relationship     | Use For                          |

## Health Profiles

Each household member can have a detailed health profile with important medical information.

### What to Track

- **Blood Type** — Critical for emergencies
- **Allergies** — Medications, foods, environmental
- **Current Medications** — What they're taking
- **Emergency Contact** — Who to call in an emergency

### Why This Matters

Having this information readily available can be life-saving. When you're at the doctor's office or in an emergency, you won't have to remember everything from memory.

## Health Conditions

Track ongoing health conditions for each family member.

### Adding a Condition

1. Select a household member
2. Go to their **Health > Conditions** tab
3. Click **Add Condition**
4. Enter:
   - **Condition Name** — e.g., "Hypertension", "Asthma"
   - **Diagnosed Date** — When it was diagnosed
   - **Status** — Active, In Remission, Resolved
   - **Notes** — Treatment details, triggers, etc.

## Prescriptions

Never miss a refill again. Track all prescriptions with refill dates and pharmacy information.

### Tracking Prescriptions

For each prescription, you can record:

| Field              | Description                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Medication Name    | The drug name              |
| Dosage             | e.g., "10mg", "500mg"      |
| Frequency          | How often to take it       |
| Pharmacy           | Where to refill            |
| Prescribing Doctor | Who prescribed it          |
| Refills Remaining  | How many refills left      |
| Days Supply        | How long each refill lasts |

### Refill Reminders

When you enter prescription details, Deliber8 calculates when you'll need to refill based on your days supply. You'll get reminders before you run out.

## Healthcare Providers

Keep all your doctors' contact information in one place.

### Provider Information

Store for each provider:

- Name and specialty
- Phone number
- Office address
- Patient portal URL
- Notes (insurance, hours, etc.)

## Appointments

   - **Location** — If different from provider's address
   - **Notes** — Prep instructions, questions to ask
5. Set **reminders** — 1 day before, 1 hour before, etc.

## Daily Health Logs

Track daily wellness metrics to spot patterns over time.

### What to Log

- **Mood** — How you're feeling (1-5 scale)
- **Energy Level** — Your energy today (1-5 scale)
- **Sleep** — Hours slept last night
- **Medications Taken** — Check off what you took today
- **Symptoms** — Note any symptoms you experienced
- **Notes** — Anything else worth recording

### Spotting Patterns

Over time, daily logs help you see:

- How sleep affects your mood
- Whether medications are working
- Symptom triggers and patterns
- Good days vs. tough days

This data is valuable for doctor visits and understanding your health journey.

## Privacy & Security

Health information is sensitive. Deliber8 Progress takes this seriously:

- All health data is encrypted
- Only you and people you explicitly share with can see it
- Health features are org-scoped — each family has their own private data
- You can export or delete your health data anytime
