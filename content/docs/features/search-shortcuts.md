   - Press `Esc` to close the search modal

### What Can You Search?

The search looks through:

- **Goal titles** and descriptions
- **Objective titles**

Results show relevant context to help you find what you need:

- **Tasks** show the category, goal, and week number

### Search Tips

- Search for partial words (e.g., "writ" finds "writing")
- Use specific terms to narrow results
- Recent tasks appear in order of creation
- Results are limited to 20 items for performance

## Keyboard Shortcuts

D8 Progress includes vim-style keyboard shortcuts for power users who prefer keyboard navigation.

### Global Shortcuts

These work anywhere in the app:

| Shortcut | Action                             |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `/`      | Open search                        |
| `?`      | Show all keyboard shortcuts        |
| `n`      | Create new task (from weekly view) |
| `Esc`    | Close modals                       |

### Weekly View Shortcuts

When viewing your tasks for the week:

| Shortcut | Action                                   |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `j`      | Select next task                         |
| `k`      | Select previous task                     |
| `Enter`  | Toggle selected task (mark done/pending) |

**Note:** Keyboard shortcuts don't work when you're typing in an input field.

### Viewing All Shortcuts

Press `?` anywhere in the app to see the complete list of keyboard shortcuts with descriptions.

The help modal shows:

- The key to press
- What the shortcut does
- Which page it's available on

### Shortcuts in Action

**Quick Task Completion:**

1. Navigate to the weekly view
2. Press `j` or `k` to highlight a task
3. Press `Enter` to mark it complete
4. Keep pressing `j` and `Enter` to blast through your list!

**Find and Navigate:**

1. Press `/` to open search
2. Type part of a task or goal name
3. Click the result to jump there immediately

### Accessibility

Keyboard shortcuts are designed to:

- Work alongside mouse/touch navigation
- Not interfere with screen readers
- Follow familiar patterns (vim-style navigation)
- Be disabled when typing in forms

All features remain fully accessible via mouse, touch, or keyboard.

## Search Best Practices

### Organizing for Search

To make search most effective:

1. **Use descriptive titles**
   - ✅ "Write blog post about keyboard shortcuts"
   - ❌ "Write thing"

2. **Add context in descriptions**
   - Tasks: Include key details
   - Goals: Explain the why

3. **Use consistent naming**
   - If you always call it "weekly review", search will find it easily

### When to Use Search vs Navigation

**Use Search When:**

- You remember the name but not the location
- You're looking for a specific task across weeks
- You want to find all instances of a keyword

**Use Navigation When:**

- Browsing current week's tasks
- Reviewing goals in a category
- Planning upcoming weeks

Both approaches work great - use whichever fits your workflow!
