The **Weekly View** is where you'll spend most of your time in Deliber8 Progress. It shows all tasks assigned to the current week, organized in a way that makes sense.

## Layout

Tasks are grouped by:

1. **Category** (if you use them)
2. **Goal** within each category
3. **Objective** within each goal

This hierarchy helps you see context — you're not just checking off random boxes, you're making progress on things that matter.

## Navigation

Use the **← Previous** and **Next →** buttons to move between weeks. The header shows:

- Week number (e.g., "Week 49")
- Date range (e.g., "Dec 2-8, 2025")

## Completing Tasks

Click the checkbox to mark a task complete. You'll see:

- The checkbox fills in
- (If gamification is on) XP animation
- The task stays visible but styled as complete

Completed tasks stay visible until the week ends, so you can see what you've accomplished.

## Adding Tasks

You can add tasks directly from the Weekly View:

1. Click **+ Add Task** under any goal
2. Type the task title
3. It's automatically assigned to the current week

## Tips for ADHD Brains

- **Don't overload** — If you have 50 tasks for the week, you'll feel overwhelmed and do none
- **Use "must do" sparingly** — Not everything is urgent
- **Move things freely** — It's okay to push tasks to next week
- **Celebrate completions** — Each checkbox is a win
