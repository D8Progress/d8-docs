  Choose the right structure for different kinds of work.

Not all work is the same. A quick errand needs different structure than a 6-month project. Deliber8 Progress gives you four objective types to match your work style.

## Simple

**Best for:** Quick wins, small projects, anything with ≤7 tasks

A flat list of tasks. No phases, no recurrence, just checkboxes.

**Example:** "Set up home office"

- Buy desk
- Buy chair
- Set up monitor
- Organize cables
- Add plant

## Milestone

**Best for:** Projects with distinct phases, anything with dependencies

Tasks are grouped into milestones (phases). You work through one milestone at a time.

**Example:** "Launch mobile app"

- **Milestone 1: Alpha**
  - Build core features
  - Internal testing
- **Milestone 2: Beta**
  - Fix alpha bugs
  - Add polish
  - Beta tester feedback
- **Milestone 3: Launch**
  - Final fixes
  - App store submission
  - Marketing push

Milestones can have target weeks, helping you plan long-term.

## Habit

**Best for:** Recurring behaviors, ongoing practices

Habits generate tasks automatically based on a schedule. When you complete a habit task, the next occurrence is created.

**Example:** "Exercise routine" (3x per week)

- Each week, three "Exercise" tasks appear
- Complete them to build your streak
- Miss too many? Streak resets (unless you use a shield!)

Habits are the heart of the streak system.

## Checklist

**Best for:** Repeatable processes, templates

A checklist is a template that spawns fresh tasks when you "run" it. Great for things you do periodically but not on a fixed schedule.

**Example:** "Weekly Review" checklist

- Review completed tasks
- Move incomplete tasks
- Plan next week
- Update goals

When you start a weekly review, these tasks are created fresh. Complete them, and the checklist is ready to run again.

## Choosing the Right Type

| Situation                                  | Type      |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| One-time project, few tasks                | Simple    |
| One-time project, many phases              | Milestone |
| Something I do regularly on a schedule     | Habit     |
| Something I do periodically, not scheduled | Checklist |

You can't change an objective's type after creation, so think about it briefly — but don't overthink. You can always create a new objective if you chose wrong.
