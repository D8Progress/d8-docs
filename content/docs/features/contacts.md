Staying in touch is hard, especially for neurodivergent brains. Deliber8 Progress helps you manage contacts and remember to nurture important relationships.

## Contact Types

Organize your contacts by relationship type:

| Type         | Use For                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Family       | Relatives (with specific sub-relationships) |
| Friend       | Friends and acquaintances                   |
| Professional | Doctors, lawyers, accountants, therapists   |
| Business     | Work contacts, clients, vendors             |
| Other        | Anyone who doesn't fit above                |

### Family Sub-Relationships

For family contacts, you can specify the exact relationship:

- Parent, Sibling, Child
- Grandparent, Grandchild
- Aunt, Uncle, Cousin
- In-laws
- And more...

## Adding Contacts

### Basic Information

Every contact has:

- **Name** — Their full name
- **Relationship Type** — Family, Friend, Professional, etc.
- **Sub-Relationship** — More specific (e.g., "Primary Care" for a doctor)

### Contact Details

Add multiple ways to reach them:

**Phone Numbers**

- Type: Home, Work, Mobile, Other
- Mark one as "preferred"

**Email Addresses**

- Type: Personal, Work, Other
- Mark one as "preferred"

**Address**

- Street, City, State, Zip
- Useful for sending cards or visiting

### Professional Details

For professional contacts, track additional info:

| Field        | Example               |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| Title        | MD, Esq., CPA         |
| Organization | City Medical Center   |
| Specialty    | Primary Care, Tax Law |

This is especially useful for doctors, lawyers, and other service providers you interact with regularly.

## Favorites

Mark important contacts as **favorites** for quick access. Favorites appear at the top of your contact list and can be accessed from the quick action menu.

## Interaction Tracking

The real power of contacts is tracking your interactions. Never wonder "When did I last talk to Mom?" again.

### Logging Interactions

After you connect with someone:

1. Open their contact
2. Click **Log Interaction**
3. Record:
   - **Type** — Call, Text, Email, In Person, Video, Mail
   - **Date** — When it happened
   - **Notes** — What you talked about
   - **Follow-up Needed** — Check if you need to do something

### Interaction Types

| Type      | Icon | Use For                      |
| --------- | ---- | ---------------------------- |
| Call      | 📞   | Phone conversations          |
| Text      | 💬   | SMS or messaging apps        |
| Email     | 📧   | Email exchanges              |
| In Person | 👥   | Face-to-face meetings        |
| Video     | 🎥   | Video calls (Zoom, FaceTime) |
| Mail      | 📮   | Letters and packages         |
| Other     | 📝   | Anything else                |

### Why Track Interactions?

- **Remember conversations** — "What did we discuss last time?"
- **Maintain relationships** — See who you haven't contacted recently
- **Follow up** — Don't forget promises you made
- **Patterns** — Understand how often you connect with people

## Contact Notes

Add notes to any contact for things you want to remember:

- Birthday and anniversary dates
- Gift ideas
- Topics they mentioned wanting to discuss
- Personal details (kids' names, hobbies, etc.)

## Archiving Contacts

When someone is no longer relevant but you don't want to delete them:

1. Open the contact
2. Click **Archive**

Archived contacts:

- Don't appear in your main list
- Are still searchable
- Can be restored anytime
- Preserve all interaction history

## Tips for ADHD Brains

### Set Relationship Goals

Think about who matters most and how often you want to connect:

- **Weekly**: Spouse, kids, best friend
- **Bi-weekly**: Close family, close friends
- **Monthly**: Extended family, good friends
- **Quarterly**: Professional contacts, acquaintances

### Use the Dashboard

Your contact dashboard shows:

- Who you haven't talked to recently
- Upcoming follow-ups
- Contact frequency trends

### Link to Quick Notes

When someone mentions something in conversation, jot it in Quick Notes and tag it with their name. You can convert it to a contact note later.
