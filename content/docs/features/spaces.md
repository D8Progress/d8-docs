Spaces bring your team, family, or friend group together in organized communication hubs. Think of them as your own private Discord server—channels for different topics, direct messages for private chats, and all the context you need in one place.

## What Are Spaces?

A **Space** is a communication workspace within your organization. Each space contains:

- **Channels** — Organized areas for specific topics
- **Members** — People who can participate
- **Roles** — Owner, Admin, or Member permissions

Common use cases:

- **Family Space** — Coordinate schedules, shopping, health, and activities
- **Friend Group** — Plan events, share memes, discuss hobbies
- **Work Team** — Track projects, make decisions, share updates

## Creating a Space

1. Click **+ New Space** in the sidebar
2. Choose a starting point:
   - **Family Space** — Pre-built channels for household coordination
   - **Friend Group** — Channels for socializing and planning
   - **Blank** — Start from scratch
   - **Custom Template** — Use one you saved previously
3. Enter space details:
   - **Name** — What to call your space
   - **Description** — (Optional) Explain its purpose
   - **Icon** — Choose an emoji to identify it
   - **Visibility** — Public or Private
4. Click **Create Space**

### Visibility Options

| Visibility | Who Can See It           | Who Can Join        |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------- |
| Public     | All organization members | Anyone can join     |

## Space Roles

| Role   | Can Do                                      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| Owner  | Everything — full control over the space    |
| Admin  | Manage channels, members, and settings      |
| Member | View channels and participate in discussion |

The person who creates a space becomes its owner.

## Tips for ADHD Brains

### Start Simple

Don't create 20 channels on day one. Start with:

- #general
- #announcements
- 1-2 topic channels

Add more as conversations naturally develop.

### Use Categories

Visual organization helps! Group channels by:

- Purpose (Planning, Health, Fun)
- Urgency (Active, Reference, Archive)
- Person (if tracking individual things)

### Pin Important Things

When someone posts something important:

1. Click the message menu
2. Select **Pin**
3. Find it later in the **Pinned** panel

No more scrolling through history to find that one message.

### Archive, Don't Delete

When a channel is done but might be useful later, archive it instead of deleting. All the history stays searchable.
