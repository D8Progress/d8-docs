  XP, levels, streaks, and achievements — dopamine on demand.

> **Note:** Gamification features are available starting in version 0.3.

Deliber8 Progress includes optional gamification to keep your brain engaged long-term. Unlike habit apps that expect habits to become "automatic," we know that ADHD brains need ongoing rewards.

## XP and Levels

Every action earns **Experience Points (XP)**:

| Action                  |         XP |
| ----------------------- | ---------: |
| Complete a task         |        +10 |
| Complete a habit        |        +15 |
| Complete an objective   |        +50 |
| Achieve a goal          |       +200 |
| Maintain a 7-day streak | +100 bonus |
| Log actual time spent   |         +5 |

XP accumulates toward **levels**. Each level requires more XP than the last. Level up to unlock achievements and (in Party Mode) new cosmetics.

## Streaks

**Streaks** track consecutive completions of habits. A daily habit completed 5 days in a row = 5-day streak.

Streaks provide:

- Visual motivation (watch the number grow!)
- Bonus XP at milestones (7 days, 30 days, etc.)
- A reason to keep going

### Streak Shields 🛡️

Life happens. You'll miss days. **Streak Shields** prevent one miss from destroying your streak.

- You get **2 shields per month**
- When you miss a habit, you can choose to use a shield to preserve your streak
- Your streak survives — the missed day is forgiven!
- Shields reset on the 1st of each month
- Your remaining shields are displayed in the navbar (in Full/Lite modes)

**Why this matters:** This is a forgiveness mechanic designed for neurodivergent brains. One bad day shouldn't undo weeks of progress. Traditional habit apps punish you for missing a single day, which often leads to giving up entirely. With streak shields, you can recover and keep going.

Using a shield also unlocks the **Comeback Kid** achievement!

## Achievements

**Achievements** are milestones that celebrate your progress. Each achievement awards bonus XP and gold when unlocked.

## Gamification Modes

Not everyone wants the full RPG experience. Choose your level:

| Mode           | What You Get                                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Full Party** | Characters, gold, shop, cosmetics, home decoration |
| **Lite**       | XP, levels, streaks, achievements (no gold/shop)   |
| **Stats Only** | Progress stats dashboard, no gamification UI       |
| **Minimal**    | Just task tracking, no extras                      |

You can change modes anytime in Settings.
