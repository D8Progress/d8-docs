> **Note:** Quick Capture features are available starting in version 0.8.

ADHD brains have thoughts that arrive fast and leave faster. Quick Capture helps you catch them before they disappear.

## Quick Notes

The fastest way to capture a thought. Open the app, type, done.

### Creating a Quick Note

**From anywhere in the app:**

1. Press **Ctrl+N** (or **Cmd+N** on Mac)
2. Type your thought
3. Press **Enter**

That's it. The note is saved and you can get back to what you were doing.

**From the Quick Notes page:**

1. Click the text area
2. Type your note
3. Click **Save** or press **Enter**

### Note Features

**Automatic Link Detection**

If your note contains URLs, they're automatically extracted and saved as clickable links. Write:

> "Check out https://example.com for vacation ideas"

And the link becomes clickable in your note.

**Tags**

Add hashtags to organize notes:

> "Buy groceries #shopping #errands"

Tags are extracted and make notes searchable.

**Folders**

Organize notes into folders:

- Inbox (default)
- Ideas
- Work
- Personal
- Custom folders you create

### Pinning Notes

Important notes that you need to see often? Pin them!

1. Open the note
2. Click the **pin icon** 📌

Pinned notes:

- Stay at the top of your list
- Are highlighted visually
- Don't get lost in the shuffle

### Converting Notes

The real power is turning notes into action. Convert a note to:

| Convert To   | What Happens                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Task         | Creates a task from the note content |

| List Item    | Adds to an existing quick list       |
| Contact Note | Attaches to a contact's profile      |
| Gift Idea    | Saves as a gift idea for a contact   |

**To convert a note:**

1. Open the note
2. Click **Convert**
3. Choose the type
4. Select destination (which list, which contact, etc.)
5. Confirm

The note moves to "Converted" status so you know it's been processed.

### Note Statuses

| Status    | Meaning                         |
| --------- | ------------------------------- |
| Inbox     | New, unprocessed note           |
| Pinned    | Important, stay visible         |
| Converted | Turned into something else      |
| Archived  | Done with, but kept for history |

## Tips for ADHD Brains

### Keep the Inbox Empty

Process your quick notes regularly. Don't let them pile up! Schedule 5 minutes daily to:

- Convert notes to tasks
- Archive notes you don't need
- Pin notes you want to keep visible

### One List Per Context

Instead of one giant list, make separate lists:

- **Grocery - Costco** (bulk items)
- **Grocery - Target** (regular items)
- **Hardware Store**
- **Online Shopping**

### Use Auto-Reset

If you have recurring checklists, auto-reset saves time. You never have to manually uncheck everything.

### Pin Sparingly

If everything is pinned, nothing stands out. Keep only 3-5 notes pinned at most.
