## Create Your First Goal

A **Goal** is a big-picture outcome you're working toward. Examples:

## Add an Objective

**Objectives** break goals into manageable chunks. For a simple goal, you might have just one objective. For complex goals, you might have several.

1. Open your goal
2. Click **+ Add Objective**
3. Choose a complexity type:
   - **Simple** — A flat list of tasks (good for most things)
   - **Milestone** — Tasks grouped into phases
   - **Habit** — Recurring tasks you do regularly
   - **Checklist** — A reusable template

## Add Tasks

**Tasks** are the actual things you do. They're the checkboxes.

1. Open an objective
2. Click **+ Add Task**
3. Type what you need to do
4. Assign it to a week (optional but recommended)

## Check the Weekly View

The **Weekly View** is your command center. It shows everything you planned to do this week, grouped by category and goal.

1. Click **Weekly** in the sidebar
