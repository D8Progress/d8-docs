## The Hierarchy

Deliber8 Progress organizes your work in three levels:

```
Category (optional grouping)
└── Goal (the big picture)
    └── Objective (a chunk of work)
        └── Task (the actual checkbox)
```

### Categories

Categories are optional folders for organizing goals. Examples:

- Health
- Career
- Learning
- Side Projects

You can color-code them for visual organization.

### Goals

A **Goal** is an outcome you're working toward. It's the "why" behind your tasks.

Goals don't have due dates by default — they're achieved when all their objectives are complete. Some goals (like "Stay healthy") might never be "complete" and that's fine.

### Objectives

**Objectives** are the "what" — concrete chunks of work that move you toward a goal.

Objectives come in four complexity types:

| Type          | Best For             | Example                                        |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Simple**    | Most things          | "Set up home gym" with 5-7 tasks               |
| **Milestone** | Projects with phases | "Launch app" with Alpha → Beta → GA milestones |
| **Habit**     | Recurring behaviors  | "Exercise 3x/week" that regenerates tasks      |
| **Checklist** | Repeatable processes | "Weekly review" template you run every week    |

### Tasks

**Tasks** are the "how" — the individual actions you take.

Tasks have:

- A title (what to do)
- An optional week assignment (when to do it)
- A completion state (done or not done)
- Optional notes

## Week-Based Planning

Deliber8 Progress uses **weeks** as the primary time unit, not days. Why?

1. **Flexibility** — Life happens. A week gives you room to adjust.
2. **Less guilt** — Missing Monday doesn't mean the week is ruined.
3. **Better for ADHD** — Hyperfocus one day, rest another. Still counts.

You assign tasks to weeks, then the Weekly View shows you everything for the current week.
